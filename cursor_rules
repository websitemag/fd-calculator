Hi there! I’m looking to set up a foundational set of Cursor rules for my project to improve AI assistance.

Please do not generate any .mdc files yet.

Right now, I just want your help in analyzing the codebase and letting me know which of the following five rule files should be created and why — based on what you find.

My goal is to establish a solid baseline and then selectively generate these rules using the /Generate Cursor Rules command afterward.

Please evaluate the following five rule types in detail and tell me which of them make sense to generate for this codebase:

1. project-overview.mdc
Should explain:

What the project is about (primary purpose or domain)

The core tech stack (language, frameworks, and key libraries — e.g., React, Node.js, Supabase, etc.)

The build system used and key configuration (e.g., package.json, webpack.config.js, Makefile)

The main entry point(s) for the application (e.g., index.ts, app.js, etc.)

Other important configuration files (e.g., .env.example, settings.ts, etc.)

Let me know if this file is applicable and what its content might need to include based on the codebase.

1. src-organization.mdc (or codebase-structure.mdc, if more appropriate)
Should describe:

The structure of the main source code directory (e.g., src/, lib/, app/, etc.)

Roles of major subdirectories (e.g., components/, hooks/, pages/, services/, utils/, api/)

Any consistent naming conventions observed (e.g., camelCase files, PascalCase components)

Please let me know if there are recognizable patterns that would be helpful to codify here.

1. api-integration.mdc
Should outline:

How the project interacts with internal or external APIs

Where API client or service logic lives (e.g., src/lib/supabaseClient.ts, services/api.ts)

Common patterns for making API calls

How authentication tokens or API keys are managed

Any central data structures (DTOs) or types consistently used

If this file isn’t relevant (e.g., no significant API usage), please let me know.

1. coding-standards.mdc (or style-guide.mdc)
Should summarize:

The overall code style and formatting conventions (e.g., Prettier rules, ESLint config)

Patterns for modularity and separation of concerns (e.g., one component per file, small reusable functions)

Any design patterns used (or anti-patterns avoided)

How error handling is typically done (e.g., try/catch, custom error classes, logging)

Let me know what kinds of standards or preferences seem worth capturing here.

1. security-considerations.mdc
Should capture:

Key security practices observed (e.g., authentication workflows, secure access control)

Sensitive parts of the codebase that need special handling (e.g., auth, payments, uploads)

Compliance requirements (e.g., data privacy, encryption) if relevant

Details on input validation, secrets management (e.g., use of .env), Supabase RLS, etc.
If this isn’t directly relevant, let me know — or tell me what could go into this file if security concerns do exist.

Please respond with:

A short analysis for each of the five rules

Whether it makes sense to generate that rule for this specific codebase

And any suggestions you’d make before I run the /Generate Cursor Rules command
